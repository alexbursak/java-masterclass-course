Lesson 1-18
Intro...

Lesson 19
Project setup

Lesson 20
Hello world (classic...)

Lesson 21
Working with printing string

Lesson 22
Variables

Lesson 23
Variables & Expressions

Lesson 24
Primitive types(8):
    1) boolean -
    2) byte - between -128 and 127 (8 bits)
    3) char - single character only (16 bits) allows to store unicode, that is why not 8 bits
    4) short - between -32768 and 32767 (16 bits)
    5) int - between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (32 bits)
    6) long - between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807 (64 bits) range is 2^63
    7) float - single precision (32 bits)
    8) double - double precision (64 bits)
Package - a way to organize java project (like namespaces in PHP?)
Java uses wrapper classes for all primitive types
Underscores can bu used in numbers to make big numbers more readable. eg 2147483647 => 2_147_483_647

Lesson 25
Byte and short and long
Width of primitive type is a number of bits it occupies. eg byte is 8 bits so the with of 8
To force long type - all 'L' in the end of value. eg 100L

Lesson 26
Casting types

Lesson 27
Some coding practice.

Lesson 28
Float and double
Good practice: add 'f' for floats in the end and 'd' for doubles for round numbers. eg. 4f and 7d
double is assumed to be default for numbers with decimals.

Lesson 29
Float and double
Double is faster to process for modern computers (interesting)
Use double instead of float
float and double are not great for floating point operations due to how those values are stored
and this is not Java issue. Therefore `BigDecimal` was introduced.

Lesson 30
Char & boolean
Char can store only single character

Lesson 31
String data type.
String can fit up to max_value of an int.
Strings in Java are immutable, when you changing a string - new String object is created.
String class in Java sets to be used in easy and simple way compared to other classes because it is
heavily used.

Lesson 32
Operators
Operator - symbol that perform an operation
Operand - any object manipulated by operator
Expression - combination of variables, literal, return values and operators. (operators and operands combined)

Lesson 33
Operation abbreviation.
Things like `variable++`, `+variable`, `+=` and so on ...

Lesson 34
if-then statement (aka conditional logic/statement)

Lesson 35
Working on operators ('>', '<', '!=', etc)
`&&` logical 'AND' operator
`&` bitwise 'AND' operator

Lesson 36
Working on expression (using pretences and logical OR)
`||` logical 'OR' operator
`|` bitwise 'OR' operator

Lesson 37
Equal operator

Lesson 38
Ternary operators

Lesson 39
Operator precedence
